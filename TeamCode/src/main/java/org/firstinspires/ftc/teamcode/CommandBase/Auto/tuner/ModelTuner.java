/**
 * Model-based PD gain computation. Everything here is driven by on-robot
 * measurements made by PathTuner - there are no hand-set numbers.
 *
 * Inputs (all measured):
 *   aFwd / aStr / aTurn - acceleration produced per unit motor power
 *                         (cm/s^2 per power, deg/s^2 per power for turn),
 *                         from a least-squares fit of the full-power ramp.
 *   ksFwd / ksStr / ksTurn - breakaway (static friction) power per axis,
 *                            from a slow power ramp until movement.
 *   tolX / tolY / tolH  - stop tolerances, derived from the stiction position
 *                         quantum (smallest reliable move), not hand-picked.
 *   tsX / tsY / tsH     - settling-time targets, driven down by PathTuner's
 *                         probe search until each axis just meets tolerance.
 *
 * Gain math - standard pole placement on the near-target 2nd-order loop
 *     error'' + A*Kd*error' + A*Kp*error = 0
 *     Kp = wn^2/A,  Kd = 2*zeta*wn/A,  wn = 4/(zeta*ts),  zeta = 1
 * with two fixes over the old version:
 *
 * 1. ANTI-TWITCH ENDPOINT CAP. Endpoint twitch is stick-slip: PD power below
 *    static friction leaves the robot stuck, error integrates nowhere, then a
 *    disturbance breaks it loose and it lurches. The cure is to guarantee that
 *    inside the tolerance box the commanded power stays BELOW breakaway, so
 *    the robot simply stays put once it is in tolerance:
 *        Kp_end <= kS / tol
 *    Endpoint Kp is min(pole-placement Kp, that cap).
 *
 * 2. DAMPING PRESERVED THROUGH CLAMPS. If Kp is capped/clamped, Kd is
 *    re-derived from the ACTUAL Kp so the pair stays critically damped:
 *        Kd = 2*zeta*sqrt(Kp/A)
 *    (The old code clamped Kp and Kd independently, which silently produced
 *    underdamped pairs - the source of the wobble.)
 *
