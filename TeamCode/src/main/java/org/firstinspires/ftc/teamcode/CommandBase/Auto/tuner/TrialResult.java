/**
 * Metrics captured for a single test-path run, and the cost derived from them.
 *
 * Cost policy (lower is better), for the "loose" gate (posTol = 6, hdgTol = 5):
 *   - left the safe box            -> huge penalty (candidate is dangerous)
 *   - timed out / outside gate     -> big penalty scaled by how far off it was
 *   - inside gate                  -> settleTime + overshoot + residual error
 *
 * Speed is rewarded implicitly: a candidate that settles faster (lower
 * settleTime) while staying in the gate wins, so the tuner naturally prefers
 * the most aggressive gains that still land accurately.
